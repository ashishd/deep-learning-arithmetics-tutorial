# Training a Sobel kernel
Training a kernel using Gradient Descent

## Prerequisites

You need to install OpenCV from sources to support C++ projects. See https://github.com/doleron/deep-learning-arithmetics-tutorial/blob/main/cpp/installing_opencv_ubuntu_20.04.md

## Building and running

To build the project:

```bash
$ cd training_sobel
training_sobel$ mkdir build
training_sobel$ cd build
training_sobel/build$ cmake ..
training_sobel/build$ make
```

To run:

```bash
training_sobel/build$ ./training_sobel 
```
